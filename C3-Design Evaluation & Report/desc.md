# Context
This assignment is about evaluation planning for your Visualization Concept design. In class, you used the Five Design Sheets (FDS) method to begin designing ideas for your Concept. You also need to plan how you will evaluate the efficacy of your visualization design and obtain some preliminary results.

This submission consists of a document containing the Evaluation Plan used for getting user feedback, and a summary of the results of all of your prototype testing (i.e., in class and outside tests).

# What to do
* Create your low-fidelity prototype
* Create a prototype usability test and get results
* Summarize the plan and results in a document and turn it in

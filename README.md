# Affordable-Care-Act-Analysis

## Analyzing the impact of the policy, Affordable Care Act, introduced by US Congress in 2010


United States happens to be one of the only few developed nations, where healthcare is almost unaffordable for a large section of its population. Before 2010, US spent over 18% of its GDP on health, whereas countries like Germany and Australia spent only between 9-11%.

To tackle this issue, President Obama’s administration had launched the health reform – the Affordable Care Act (ACA is popularly known as Obamacare) in 2010, which expanded Medicaid eligibility to larger parts of the uninsured population. The ACA has improved health coverage for people of color significantly. Despite this, it is said to have many cons and less than 50% of the population wholly supports the Act. 


Goal: To visualize the pros and cons of the Affordable Care Act 2010, and to understand the pain points of Act which can be improved

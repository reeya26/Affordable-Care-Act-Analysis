The Visualization Concept demonstrates your proficiency in the terminology, principles, tools, and techniques of visualization design through a working visualization and documentation of your efforts producing it. Your visualization should draw upon a data source you have identified to support exploration of the idea you presented in your Concept Pitch. Your Concept includes a short overview document describing the visualization, the work you did to produce it and conclusions you have drawn.
